        How to do virtually anything on a school chromebook 
    </h1>
    I am not responsible for any trouble that you may get into.
    <h2>The "login" exploit</h2>
    1. Start with the chromebook login screen, and continue with your google account. <br>
    2. When you reach the sign-in page hosted by Microsoft, scroll down and click other sign-in options.<br>
    3. Continue with Github<br>
    4. On the Github login page, scroll down and click on Docs.<br>
    5. Scroll all the way to the bottom and click on Pricing.<br>
    6. Scroll all the way to the bottom (again)<br>
    You should see the icons of X, Tiktok, Instagram, Youtube, and more. Click on any of them to access their respective websites.
    If you want to access anything else, go to the search button on the top of the pricing page and search "google". Click on the "google.com" link on the right side of the page and you will be redirected to the google search page. From there, you can search anything you want.
